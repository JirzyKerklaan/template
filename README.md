# Template

Template is an application which is created to show off my skills. I used Strapi in combination with React, I chose to use Strapi for easy manageability and React for a fast user experience.

During the production of the application, I encountered multiple challenges. One significant issue was with the population settings of the GET requests made to Strapi. I resolved this by installing an NPM addon that ensures all requests are always fully populated.

### For development of the project

First you should navigate to the react-app

    cd react-app

Then you should run the application with npm

    npm start

After this, you should start the strapi application, this is done in the following way,

First run,

    cd strapi

Then run,

    npm run strapi dev

When running the application you should keep in mind that it is not in it's final stage yet.
